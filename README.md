## Overview
Bernoulli's Principle states that **an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy**. This principle is widely used in aerodynamics, hydraulics, and other fields of fluid mechanics.

This project includes:
- Python scripts for simulating fluid flow.
- MATLAB scripts for pressure and velocity calculations.
- Visualizations of fluid dynamics.

## Key Concepts
1. **Bernoulli's Equation**:
   \[
   P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P \) = pressure
   - \( \rho \) = fluid density
   - \( v \) = fluid velocity
   - \( g \) = acceleration due to gravity
   - \( h \) = height above a reference point

2. **Applications**:
   - Aerodynamics (lift in airplane wings)
   - Venturi effect (flow in constricted pipes)
   - Fluid flow in pipes and channels
